# Low Issues

## L-1: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

## L-2: Empty `require()` / `revert()` statements

Use descriptive reason strings or custom errors for revert paths.

	```solidity

	```solidity

## L-5: Unused Custom Error

it is recommended that the definition be removed when custom error is unused

	```solidity
	    error HH__HawkHighFeesNotPaid();
	```

</details>



## L-6: Potentially unused `private` / `internal` state variables found.

State variable appears to be unused. No analysis has been performed to see if any inilne assembly references it. So if that's not the case, consider removing this unused variable.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/LevelTwo.sol [Line: 12](src/LevelTwo.sol#L12)

	```solidity
	    bool inSession;
	```

</details>



## L-7: Boolean equality is not required.

If `x` is a boolean, there is no need to do `if(x == true)` or `if(x == false)`. Just use `if(x)` and `if(!x)` respectively.

	```solidity

	```solidity
	        if (inSession == false) {
	```

</details>



## L-8: Costly operations inside loops.

Invoking `SSTORE`operations in loops may lead to Out-of-gas errors. Use a local variable to hold the loop computation result.
